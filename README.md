I am a junior software developer, specializing in the app development arena. I have been developing websites and applications using python, and JavaScript. HTML, React JS and SQL.

Being a student at Moringa School, I'm hands-on in all stages of the software dev cycle. From planning and design to testing and development. No two days are the same for me; my task may involve analysing algorithms, fixing bugs, brainstorming ideas or integrating new systems.

I am also a leader by nature and a rugby cum soccer player by training.
